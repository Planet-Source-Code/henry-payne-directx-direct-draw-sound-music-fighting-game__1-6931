## DirectX: Direct Draw, Sound & Music Fighting Game


</div>

### Description

This is a DirectX Fighting game like the original Mortal Kombat, it uses direct draw, direct sound & direct music. Currently Multiplayer is not available.

I had to drop the IMAGE & SOUND Quality heaps so that planet-souce-code would let me upload it, otherwise it would be too big, e-mail me if you want the higher quality sound and graphics.
